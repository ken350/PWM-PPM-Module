# PWM-PPM-module
- this project provide a Verilg implementation for PWM and PPM module which is a digital system
- i use vivado for the simulation
- you can see the time diagram and the schematics
- i provie test benches for each building block in the module and test bench for the module itself
- i didn't include the ADC in the module
- to run the project open **PWM_Module.xpr** with vivado
- to see the source codes check **PWM_Module.srcs** folder
have a nice day
